This is exactly the right diagnosis, and the solution you laid out is spot-on. Replit is limited for browser automation, and dynamic React apps don‚Äôt give you anything useful in the page source. You‚Äôre wasting time fighting rendering ‚Äî the real move is API interception.

Here‚Äôs the clean, copy-paste prompt to give your Replit AI coder to shift from scraping to real API discovery:


---

REPLIT INSTRUCTION:


---

‚úÖ Objective:
Stop trying to scrape rendered content from https://knightsofdegen.netlify.app/. Instead, we need to find and use the backend API that the site uses to load character data and image URLs.


---

üîç How to do this:

1. Inspect Network Calls

Open Chrome DevTools on https://knightsofdegen.netlify.app/

Go to the Network tab

Refresh the page and watch for any XHR or fetch requests (look for .json, .graphql, .api, etc.)



2. Look for API Endpoints

Examples of what to look for:

https://api.knightsofdegen.com/characters

https://cdn.contentful.com/...

https://*.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/*

GraphQL endpoints (/graphql)




3. Find JSON with Character Data

You're looking for an endpoint that returns character name, traits, and image URLs

Make sure the request has no auth or uses headers we can replicate



4. Copy a Sample Response

Once found, extract the actual JSON data structure

It should contain something like:

{
  "id": "123",
  "name": "Knight 001",
  "image": "https://cdn.knightsofdegen.net/...jpg"
}



5. Use Python or JS to Call This API Directly

Make an HTTP request (e.g., fetch in JS or requests.get() in Python)

Parse and display/store the character data

Save or download the image URLs if needed





---

üö´ DO NOT:

Do not use Puppeteer or Selenium ‚Äî these fail in Replit‚Äôs sandbox

Do not try to guess URLs or scrape the page source

Do not assume image URL patterns



---

‚úÖ What You Should Return:

A clean list of character data, like:

[
  {
    "name": "Knight of Degen #147",
    "image": "https://images.ctfassets.net/...jpg",
    "traits": [...]
  },
  ...
]


---

If needed, I can write the request code for you once the correct API URL and headers (if any) are known.
